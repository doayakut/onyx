# Onyx Theme

A dark theme with limited syntax highlighting.

Inspired by minimal light themes, Onyx uses minimal amount of highlighting. So that your editor does not like a colorful impressionist painting.

Note: I wanted a dark minimal theme after using [Alabaster theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tonsky.theme-alabaster), so I modified their theme from a light theme to a dark one. Check out original theme for more info on motivation and definitions. A similar cool-toned dark theme is [Rubber theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=apust.rubber-theme).
